It is possible to notice that the dissemination of the subject is almost null and weak, because there is no incentive in schools and of the public.',

    'text5' => 'That way, we decided to create a site where it would be possible to learn and understand in a interative and funny way, the complexes subjects related to astronomy and astrophysis, which would keep the user\'s attention and given the ease function wouldn\'t cause discouragement and disinterest.',

This game would approach the subjects in a dynamic and easy way, with the main focus being important discoverys and theories about the Cosmos, exploration missions, where which stage would be wrought to make the discoverys/theories something newsworthy, where the user would learn and have fun at the same time.',

Lots of researches was made previously so we would have lots of content to work with. For example, the Municipal planetarium at Campinas recived our visit and gave us lots of information to our project. Their simulador was the great inspiration to build our own. The final project - Cosmos Project, was presentated to the public in ETEC Pedro Ferreira Alvesd in the 2015\'s Expoete, where people came by and given the project\'s popularity there was queue of people waiting to see the project, yet lots of people didn\'t have the opportunity to enter.',
